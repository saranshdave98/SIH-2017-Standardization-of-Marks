# SIH 2017 Standardization of Marks
 This project is based on the problem statement provided by the Minstry of HRD (India) for Smart India Hackathon '17. As per the given problem statement, we need to solve the problem of bunching of marks at certain levels and problem of high scorers being at disadvantageous position due to lower competitive percentile.
